            <div class="bold-text">Our team of registered nurses and skilled healthcare professionals provide in-home
                nursing to help manage and coordinate recovery at home.</div>
            <div class="text">We are an in-home care company that happens to operate through independently owned and
                operated home care franchisees. We're not a franchise company trying to do business in the home care
                industry. Because of this, the safety and well being of our clients comes first for everyone.</div>

                        mission: To enhance the lives of aging adults and their families.</div>
                    <div class="text">When our founder Ann Javelona began providing care for her grandmother
                        to help her remain at home, they envisioned a future where all people could age with greater
                        hope and success. We strive to make that vision a reality with every life we are privileged to
                        touch.</div>
